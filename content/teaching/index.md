### Courses

Short descriptions and syllabi of courses I've taught:

- {{% staticref "files/teaching/soc_mngt_410_syllabus_v3.pdf" %}}MNGT/SOCI 410: Formal Organizations and Bureaucracy (spring 2019){{% /staticref %}}

	Semester-long project: Assignment guidelines for {{% staticref "files/teaching/research_question_guidelines.pdf" %}}research question{{% /staticref %}}, analyses, and final paper.

	Organizations are everywhere. Nearly all of us spend a considerable amount of time as part of an organization. Organizations provide most of our goods and services, influence our beliefs and values, and shape and are shaped by larger institutions in society. In this course, we will explore the interactions that go on inside organizations, and more importantly, how organizations interact with each other and with their environments.

- {{% staticref "files/teaching/soc273_fa_2018.pdf" %}}SOCI 273: Social and Economic Justice (fall 2018){{% /staticref %}}

	In this course, we will focus on three main questions. First, what explains social and economic inequality? Second, what have social scientists and political philosophers argued would constitute a more equal and just society? And third, what role do schools and civil society organizations play in perpetuating or alleviating social and economic inequality?

- {{% staticref "files/teaching/soc133_sp_2018.pdf" %}}SOCI 133: Sociology of Politics (fall 2017 and spring 2018){{% /staticref %}}

	Class [material](https://github.com/alturkaa/soc133) for data analysis

	Why do individuals participate in politics (e.g., vote) or become engaged in their communities (e.g., join a voluntary association, protest, etc.)? What role do social networks play in political and civic engagement? What accounts for the increasing political partisanship in the United States? And how do the shifts in political participation, civic engagement, and partisanship all have an effect on, or are shaped by, policymaking?

- {{% staticref "files/teaching/soc250_ss2_2017.pdf" %}}SOCI 250: Social Theory (summer 2017){{% /staticref %}}

	What explains inequality? Why do people make the decisions that they do? How do values, norms, and culture shape individual and group choices? Why do individuals ascribe very different meanings to the same set of facts? These are some of the questions we will explore in this course. You amass a lot of information everyday---whether in class, online, or from family and friends---and the goal of theory is to provide you with explanations about all of that information. Specifically, this course is an introduction to sociological theory, which helps us understand the social world. We will read both classical theorists---many who grappled with understanding changes caused by modernity---and contemporary thinkers who've revised and expanded on those older theories.
