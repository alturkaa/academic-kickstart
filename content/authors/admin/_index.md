Welcome to my website! Here you'll find more about research I'm working on, courses I've taught, and a little about my work experience. I am the Director of Research and Evaluation at the Ending Community Homelessness Coalition (ECHO). I got my PhD in the [Sociology Department](https://sociology.unc.edu/) at UNC-Chapel Hill in 2020, and I have a Master's from the [LBJ School of Public Affairs](https://lbj.utexas.edu/) at UT-Austin. Before getting my PhD, I worked at the International Budget Partnership (in the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities) and the Brookings Institution.
